The first is a specification for modular components called Bundles. The specification defines an infrastructure for a bundle’s life cycle and determines how bundles will interact. The second is a JVM-level service registry that bundles can use to publish, discover and bind to services in a Service-Oriented Architecture.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can learn more about OSGi in here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This post will be served as a quick guide to develop OSGi components, a producer component to publish services and a consumer component to use the published service to fulfill its requirements.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<h3>Fabricator</h3>\n<p>Fabricator (Producer) component has a single service which is exposed to the outside to generate and provide facts about the OS and the logged-in user. The current implementation uses a model named Fact to share the data between OSGi components.</p>\n<!-- `gist:athiththan11//07ca06da6eae5cd1019f3c57762c8aec#Fact.java` -->\n<p>Given below is the implementation of the class named FactFabricator which exposes a single service named getSimpleFact().</p>\n<!-- `gist:athiththan11//9c434a72013cff08a3ea9b93f8568a83#FactFabricator.java` -->\n<p>The Fabricator component has to be registered with the Bundle Context in order to be used by other service components.</p>\n<!-- `gist:athiththan11//160a16cfbb4fe09261d8033cb7a725b9#FabricatorServiceComponent.java` -->\n<h3>Shopper</h3>\n<p>Shopper (Consumer) component is used to retrieve the facts using the exposed services of Fabricator component. The current implementation is to retrieve the data and to print on console.</p>\n<!-- `gist:athiththan11//2527e053480b031791ddf83f959f3bd7#FactShopper.java` -->\n<p>The Shopper component also has to be registered as a service component with Bundle Context. But, as of this sample, the activate() method is used to retrieve facts straightway without registering the service component.</p>\n<p>In order to grab the exposed service, a Reference annotation has been used to annotate and to refer our Fabricator service component.</p>\n<!-- `gist:athiththan11//c29e2a352a625aaf66fc33264a8e9846#ShopperServiceComponent.java` -->\n<h2>GitHub</h2>\n<br>\n<a class=\"ul-disabled\" href=\"https://github.com/athiththan11/OSGi-Producer-and-Consumer-Bundle\">\n    <div class=\"card\">\n        <div class=\"card-horizontal\">\n            <div class=\"card-body py-4 px-5\">\n                <h4 class=\"card-title mt-4\">OSGi Producer &amp; Consumer Bundler</h4>\n                <p>A simple implementation of OSGi producer and consumer bundle</p>\n                <footer class=\"blockquote-footer\">\n                    <small class=\"text-muted\">\n                        athiththan11\n                    </small>\n                </footer>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"img-square-wrapper\">\n                <img class=\"rounded mb-0\" width=\"220.172\" src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/29927177?s=460&amp;v=4\" alt>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</a>\n<hr class=\"three--dots\"/>","frontmatter":{"title":"OSGi Producer and Consumer Components","intro":"Quick Start: OSGi Component Bundle Development","tags":["osgi","osgi-producer-consumer"],"author":"Athiththan"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/OSGi-Producer--Consumer-Components/","node_id":"6d26639c-de89-5038-ad26-b42f17d84d3c","nodePath":"/OSGi-Producer--Consumer-Components/","nodeType":"sheet","title":"OSGi Producer and Consumer Components","category":"OSGi","weight":-1,"updated":"2019-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Athiththan","short":"A Quick Guide on OSGi Bundle Implementation","tags":["osgi","osgi-producer-consumer"]}}
